Judiciary Automation to track Legal Court Cases <br>
<b>Technology Stack </b>
<pre>

Frontend : HTML/CSS/JS (Bootstrap Framework) 
Backend : Django 2.X
Database : Firebase Realtime Database

This was our proposed solution to the Trithon hackathon 2019.
The Application contains 4 different kind of user panel a panel for Common Citizen of the country, One for Advocates , one for Judges one for the CSI of courts.
The ideas was to automate the ccomplete cycle from filing an FIR to Closing of the cases by taking care of the possible delays that generally occur.
Time taken by each entity in the system was taken into record to find out which body causes delay in what type of cases. A Multilinear Regression model was used to generate a credit score for individuals.
Also text similarity was used to show cases with similar descriptions so that it becomes easy for the authorities to take decisions quickly by taking reference. Cosine Similarity was used here.
